	<!--<p>
	<b>Overview:</b>
	<br>Olg.ca is the gateway... My Student Support Program (My SSP) is a desktop and mobile platform where high school and university students can access support and resources to improve their mental health and overall qualilty of life. If they so choose, the schools (the clients) can replace My SSP's default icon and colours with their own branding. However, someone from the school must email the My SSP team with the customization information and our developers would have to manually change the settings for each school. <i>How might we simplify the process?</i></u>
	</p>-->
	
	<p>
	<b>Task:</b>
	<br>Redesign OLG's desktop site to boost customer appeal and retention. There are no restrictions as to which design approach can be taken.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>My approach:</b>
	<br>Although the design task was open-ended, I wanted to be realistic in the solution I provided. Although I personally was not a huge fan of the current colour scheme, I decided to keep it for two reasons:
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
		<li>Redesigning the brand would be a province-wide endeavor, and would be extremely costly (all of the products and marketing material would have to be replaced!). Thus, it would not likely be approved by the executives.</li>
		<li>Lottery/casino games are very popular among the elderly. This demographic is likely to struggle with change, especially towards a more modern aesthetic and digital experience.</li>
	</ul>
	Thus, my approach was to reorganize the content on the website while maintaining the design elements in the design system.

	<p><b>Step one:</b>
	<br>I reviewed the current website and identified potential issues the user might have. I drew from my previous experience and coursework dealing with Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics to give an informed analysis. Below is a screenshot of the "before" page, annotated with the issues I found.

	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>Putting it all together</b>
	<br>Since most of the design elements were already in the OLG design system, I was able to skip the low-fidelity step and jump right into a high-fidelity design. 
	<br>I decided to add a "Winners Spotlight" to get potential customers excited about winning. It also helps people discover new games to play by telling them who has won from them before.	
	<br>Below is the mockup of the "after" version explaining my changes.
	<br>I added a filtering tool to the games section. This helps the company deliver more relevant games to the player while making the player feel like they're getting a special, personalized experience.

	Here are the unannotated mockups, showing the three hero carousel versions:

	<p>
	<b>Final Thoughts</b>
	<br>Overall, I sought to create an experience that was easier to navigate, more exciting and personalized, and more informative.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>Next Steps</b>
	<ul>
	<li>To take this assignment a step further, I could mockup the mobile version of this page.</li> 
	<li>If research was in scope for this project, I would test the new page to see if customer navigation and retention was indeed enhanced. I would pay special attention to the new section to see how much attention and clicks it's getting.</li>
	<!--<li>The business team has also indicated they want to add additional functions for "super admins": in addition to the existing features, "super admins" should be able to add, remove, and update regular admin users. Adding future features is easily achieved through the project's Agile sprint framework. </li>-->
	</ul>
