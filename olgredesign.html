	<!--<p>
	<b>Overview:</b>
	<br>Olg.ca is the gateway... My Student Support Program (My SSP) is a desktop and mobile platform where high school and university students can access support and resources to improve their mental health and overall qualilty of life. If they so choose, the schools (the clients) can replace My SSP's default icon and colours with their own branding. However, someone from the school must email the My SSP team with the customization information and our developers would have to manually change the settings for each school. <i>How might we simplify the process?</i></u>
	</p>-->
	
	<p>
	<b>Task:</b>
	<br>Redesign OLG's desktop site to boost customer appeal and retention. There are no restrictions as to which design approach can be taken.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>My approach:</b>
	<br>Although the design task was open-ended, I wanted to be realistic in the solution I provided. Although I personally was not a huge fan of the current colour scheme, I decided to keep it for two reasons:
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
		<li>Redesigning the brand would be a province-wide endeavor, and would be extremely costly (all of the products and marketing material would have to be replaced!). Thus, it would not likely be approved by the executives.</li>
		<li>Lottery/casino games are very popular among the elderly. This demographic is likely to struggle with change, especially towards a more modern aesthetic and digital experience.</li>
	</ul>
	Thus, my approach was to reorganize the content on the website while maintaining the design elements in the design system.

	<p><b>Step one:</b>
	<br>I reviewed the current website and identified potential issues the user might have. I drew from my previous experience and coursework dealing with Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics to give an informed analysis. Below is a screenshot of the "before" page, annotated with the issues I found.

	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>Putting it all together</b>
	<br>Since most of the design elements were already in the OLG design system, I was able to skip the low-fidelity step and jump right into a high-fidelity design. Below is the mockup of the "after" version explaining my changes.
	</p>

	Here is the finished product again, without annotations:

	<p>
	<b>Final Prototype (excerpt)</b>
	<br>I applied product branding to the low-fi designs, then showed them to my colleagues for peer feedback. After making some tweaks, I reached the final design shown below. 
	<br><u>Note:</u> Since this is a recent feature, it makes use of the visual styles of the product rebrand, which was commenced January 2022. Thus, it differs visually from the older My SSP designs shown in this portfolio. (For instance, the main colour here is purple and not blue.)

	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>Outcomes</b>
	<br>Thanks to this tool, the school administrators have more convenience and control when it comes to customizing their My SSP experience. They no longer have to email My SSP reps to get customization done, and they can get immediate feedback on their app image and colour choices through the preview page. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>Next Steps</b>
	<ul>
	<li>To take this assignment a step further, I could mockup the mobile version of this page.</li> 
	<li>If research was in scope for this project, I would test the new page to see if customer navigation and retention was indeed enhanced. I would pay special attention to the new section to see how much attention and clicks it's getting.</li>
	<!--<li>The business team has also indicated they want to add additional functions for "super admins": in addition to the existing features, "super admins" should be able to add, remove, and update regular admin users. Adding future features is easily achieved through the project's Agile sprint framework. </li>-->
	</ul>
