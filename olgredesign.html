	<br>Revamping olg.ca</p>
	<!--<img src="thumbnails/banner2.png" style="width:100%">-->
	
	
	<!--<p>
	<b>Overview:</b>
	<br>Olg.ca is the gateway... My Student Support Program (My SSP) is a desktop and mobile platform where high school and university students can access support and resources to improve their mental health and overall qualilty of life. If they so choose, the schools (the clients) can replace My SSP's default icon and colours with their own branding. However, someone from the school must email the My SSP team with the customization information and our developers would have to manually change the settings for each school. <i>How might we simplify the process?</i></u>
	</p>-->
	
	<p>
	<b>Task:</b>
	<br>Redesign OLG's desktop site to boost customer appeal and retention. There are no restrictions as to which design approach can be taken.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>My approach:</b>
	<br>Although the design task was open-ended, I wanted to be realistic in the solution I provided. Although I personally was not a huge fan of the current colour scheme, I decided to keep it for two reasons:
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
		<li>Redesigning the brand would be a province-wide endeavor, and would be extremely costly (all of the products and marketing material would have to be replaced!). Thus, it would not likely be approved by the executives.</li>
		<li>Lottery/casino games are very popular among the elderly. This demographic is likely to struggle with change, especially towards a more modern aesthetic and digital experience.</li>
	</ul>
	Thus, my approach was to reorganize the content on the website while maintaining the design elements in the design system.

	<p><b>Functionalities to include:</b>
	<br>The required functionalities were identified by the business and developer teams.
	<img src="works/tasks1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto; max-width: 100%">
	<br>I realized this can be grouped into 3 main categories for easier user navigation:
	<img src="works/tasks2.png" style="display: block; margin: auto; max-width: 100%">
	<br>Thus, our <b>user flow</b> looks something like this: 
	<img src="works/flow1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto; max-width: 100%">

	<p><b>Considering different use cases:</b>
	<br>The expected users of this tool are staff members at a school that uses My SSP. While the user experience would be the same for all users in most areas of the tool, there is one divergence: a multilingual school that offers resources in multiple languages must be able to add multiple titles and URLs under one external resource entry.
	<br>I imagined two users to illustrate this point:
	</p>
		<!-- duo -->
<div class="duo-trio-container">

  <div class="duo-single">
    <b>User type 1: Ava</b>
	<br> Ava is the principal of a high school in a rural Ontario city. Since 90% of the student population counts English as their first language, all of the school's materials are in English.  
  </div>
  
  <div class="duo-single">
      <b>User type 2: Alistair</b>
	  <br> Alistair is the headmaster of an international boarding school, located in Quebec. In addition to local students, the school draws in many students from China and Europe. Thus, the school's website and resources have versions in French, English, Mandarin, and Spanish.
  </div>

  
</div>
	<!-- End of duo -->
	
	<p>Thus, a new branch is needed in our user flow:
	
	<img src="works/flow2.png" style="display: block; margin: auto; max-width: 100%">

	<b>Low-Fidelity Wireframes (excerpt)</b>
	<br>Due to the remote work situation we decided to bypass paper drawings and jump right into low-fidelity designs.

	<p>
	<b>Final High-Fidelity Mockups (excerpt)</b>
	<br>I applied product branding to the low-fi designs, then showed them to my colleagues for peer feedback. After making some tweaks, I reached the final design shown below. 
	<br><u>Note:</u> Since this is a recent feature, it makes use of the visual styles of the product rebrand, which was commenced January 2022. Thus, it differs visually from the older My SSP designs shown in this portfolio. (For instance, the main colour here is purple and not blue.)

	<b>Outcomes</b>
	<br>Thanks to this tool, the school administrators have more convenience and control when it comes to customizing their My SSP experience. They no longer have to email My SSP reps to get customization done, and they can get immediate feedback on their app image and colour choices through the preview page. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>Next Steps</b>
	<ul>
	<li>To take this assignment a step further, I could mockup the mobile version of this page.</li> 
	<li>If research was in scope for this project, I would test the new page to see if customer navigation and retention was indeed enhanced. I would pay special attention to the new section to see how much attention and clicks it's getting.</li>
	<!--<li>The business team has also indicated they want to add additional functions for "super admins": in addition to the existing features, "super admins" should be able to add, remove, and update regular admin users. Adding future features is easily achieved through the project's Agile sprint framework. </li>-->
	</ul>
